# Ethics-Class

The Python program is an encryptor to encrypt text. Once the repo is clones or the main.py file is copied and run locally, it will open a simple UI window where text can be inputted and then encrypted. It will show the output below, which can be copied and decrypted to ensure it worked correctly. It is using a simple Ceaser Cypher, which shifts the characters so they become encrypted. The program leaves the spaces as they appeared in the original text. 

The main purpose of this program is to teach basic concepts about encryption and how it works in actual code. Potential misuse can include using this program, or similar encryption ones, to actually encrypt and transfer sensitive or confidential information without proper permission.

One limitation of the program is numbers; it does not encrypt numbers, only letters.
